The left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was approximately 54 mm, and the right ventricular end-diastolic diameter was about 32 mm. Cine MRI showed left ventricular wall thickening, uncoordinated wall motion, and reduced systolic function, with no valvular regurgitation observed during diastole and systole. No pericardial or bilateral pleural effusion was detected. SPGR/IR TurboFlash imaging in the four-chamber, long-axis, and short-axis views of the left ventricle indicated subendocardial perfusion defects in the anterior wall and anterior septal wall of the mid-ventricular segment. Delayed enhancement imaging revealed patchy, inhomogeneous high signal intensity in the subendocardial to mid-myocardial layers of the anterior wall and anterior septal wall from the basal to apical segments, as well as in the anterior papillary muscle and lateral wall. The left ventricular end-diastolic wall thickness measurements (in mm) were as follows: basal segment - anterior wall 6.9, anterior septal wall 18.2, inferior/posterior septal wall 13.3, inferior/posterior wall 9.2, inferolateral wall 7.9, anterolateral wall 7.6; mid-ventricular segment - anterior wall 6.9, anterior septal wall 7.3, inferior/posterior septal wall 8.8, inferior/posterior wall 6.7, inferolateral wall 7.3, anterolateral wall 5.2; apical segment - anterior wall 6.9, anterior septal wall 9.9, inferior/posterior wall 6.2, inferolateral wall 5.1; apex - 2.9.

The end-diastolic wall thickness of the left ventricle varies across segments, with the basal segment showing thicknesses from 5.8 mm to 12.1 mm, the mid segment from 5.8 mm to 9.6 mm, and the apical segment from 3.1 mm to 8.7 mm, with the apex itself measuring about 2.6 mm thick. Cine MRI indicates absent systolic wall motion in the left ventricular septum and apex, with a low-signal blood flow jet from the mitral valve area towards the atrial outflow tract during systole. Pericardial and left pleural effusions are noted. Resting myocardial perfusion imaging shows subendocardial linear and patchy low-signal areas in the left ventricular wall. Delayed enhancement imaging reveals transmural linear high-signal areas with subendocardial low-signal lines in the left ventricular wall and septum. T2-weighted imaging shows linear and patchy high-signal areas in the anterior septum and apex of the left ventricle, with no signal reduction on fat-suppressed images. The ejection fraction is 34.4%, with an end-diastolic volume of 126.2 ml, end-systolic volume of 82.8 ml, stroke volume of 43.4 ml, cardiac output of 4.34 L/min, and left ventricular mass of 134.4 g.\n</imaging findings>\n\nBased on the imaging findings, please predict the likelyhood of the patient experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) within 85 months following the imaging examination, and answer with high or low."

T2FS sequences show artifacts with no definite high signal in the myocardium; a curvilinear low signal is seen in the mid-myocardial layer of the basal to mid inferolateral wall. T2* sequences reveal linear low signals in the basal to mid inferior and inferolateral walls. Resting myocardial perfusion imaging shows a linear perfusion defect in the subendocardial region of the basal to mid inferolateral wall. Delayed enhancement imaging shows transmural delayed enhancement in the basal to mid inferolateral wall, with a subendocardial curvilinear low signal area similar to that seen on T2FS.

The anterior-posterior diameters of the left and right atria were approximately 33mm and 34mm, respectively, with the left and right ventricular end-diastolic diameters measuring about 35mm and 32mm. Cine MRI revealed uncoordinated left ventricular wall motion, slightly reduced systolic and diastolic function in the apical segments and apex, thinning of the mid-inferolateral wall, and a regurgitant signal in the tricuspid valve area during systole. A small amount of fluid signal was observed in the pericardium, with no fluid signals in the bilateral pleural cavities. T2FS imaging showed patchy high-signal areas in the basal to apical septal wall, mid to apical anterior wall, and parts of the apical inferior and lateral walls of the left ventricle, with a subendocardial arc-like low signal in the mid to apical septal wall, some of which also appeared as low signal on T2*. Resting myocardial perfusion imaging indicated perfusion defects in the subendocardial regions of the basal to apical septal wall and parts of the basal and apical anterior walls, with slight perfusion delay in the apical anterior and inferior walls. Delayed enhancement imaging revealed subendocardial and mid-myocardial delayed enhancement in the basal to apical septal wall, mid to apical anterior wall, parts of the apical inferior and lateral walls, and the apex, with some transmural enhancement in the apical segments and apex; the extent of delayed enhancement was slightly less than the edema seen on T2FS, with the subendocardial arc-like low signal area being similar in extent to that seen on T2FS. A small amount of delayed enhancement was also noted in the right ventricular apex.

Cine MRI shows no thinning or thickening of the left ventricular wall, normal wall motion, and normal left ventricular systolic function. A bundle of low-signal blood flow is observed in the ventricular outflow tract during diastole at the aortic valve area and in the atrial outflow tract during systole at the mitral valve. No arc-shaped fluid signal is seen in the pericardium or bilateral pleural cavities. T2WI reveals patchy high signal in the middle layer of the myocardium of the left ventricular inferior and inferolateral walls with unclear boundaries. Left ventricular end-diastolic wall thickness measurements (in mm) are as follows: anterior wall 6.6, anteroseptal wall 7.8, inferoposterior septal wall 10.3, inferoposterior wall 9.3, inferolateral wall 6.9, and anterolateral wall 7.6 at the basal segment; 6.5, 10.5, 12.7, 9.3, 8.6, and 6.9 respectively at the mid segment; and 5.8, 8.0, 8.4, and 6.1 at the apical segment, with the apex at 2.5. Left ventricular function measurements: EF 65.99%, EDV 119.54 ml, ESV 40.66 ml, SV 78.89 ml, CO 5.21 L/min, LV mass 102.08 g. Myocardial rest perfusion imaging shows a subendocardial arc-shaped perfusion reduction in the basal segment of the left ventricular inferoseptal wall and from the basal to apical segments of the left ventricular inferior wall. Myocardial delayed enhancement imaging reveals transmural delayed enhancement in the basal to apical segments of the left ventricular inferior wall.\n</imaging findings>\n\nBased on the imaging findings, please predict the likelyhood of the patient experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) within 8 months following the imaging examination, and answer with high or low."

The left ventricular end-diastolic diameter is around 49.4 mm, and the right ventricular end-diastolic diameter is about 29.8 mm. Wall thickness at end-diastole varies across segments, with the apical segment showing a thickness of approximately 2.1 mm. Cine MRI indicates significantly reduced motion in the left ventricular apex and septal wall, with reverse motion observed in the apical segment. A jet-like blood flow signal towards the atrium is noted in the mitral valve area, and a low-signal area of about 7.5 mm × 6.6 mm is seen at the apex without enhancement. Pericardial fluid signals are present, but no pleural effusion is observed. Resting myocardial perfusion imaging shows perfusion defects in the left ventricular apex and septal wall. Delayed enhancement imaging reveals transmural delayed enhancement in these areas, with linear low-signal areas in the mid-apical segments. T2 fat-suppressed sequences show no significant abnormal high signals in the left ventricular wall. The ejection fraction is 35.70%, with an end-diastolic volume of 152.09 ml, end-systolic volume of 97.80 ml, stroke volume of 54.29 ml, cardiac output of 3.22 L/min, and left ventricular mass of 130.14 g.\n</imaging findings>\n\nBased on the imaging findings, please predict the likelyhood of the patient experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) within 21 months following the imaging examination, and answer with high or low."

The left atrial longitudinal diameter is approximately 39.8 mm, and the right atrial longitudinal diameter is about 41.1 mm. The left ventricular end-diastolic diameter is around 51.3 mm, and the right ventricular end-diastolic diameter is about 40.3 mm. Cine MRI shows uncoordinated movement of the left ventricular wall, particularly in the inferior wall, with no fluid signal in the pericardium and no arc-shaped fluid signals in the bilateral thoracic cavities. T2WI indicates no clear high signal in the left ventricular wall. The left ventricular end-diastolic wall thickness (in millimeters) is as follows: anterior wall 7.8, anterior septal wall 12.3, inferior/posterior septal wall 12.5, inferior/posterior wall 8.1, inferolateral wall 7.2, and anterolateral wall 9.9 at the basal segment; 7.9, 7.3, 9.8, 6.1, 7.8, and 8.3 respectively at the mid segment; and 5.6, 6.9, 6.4, and 6.2 at the apical segment, with the apex at 2.7. Left ventricular function measurements show an EF of 54.18%, EDV of 161.28 ml, ESV of 73.91 ml, SV of 87.38 ml, CO of 5.97 L/min, and LV mass of 140.7 g. Myocardial rest perfusion imaging shows no clear abnormal low perfusion in the left ventricular wall. Myocardial delayed enhancement imaging reveals multiple delayed enhancement areas in the inferior and septal walls of the left ventricle, some with transmural changes.\n</imaging findings>\n\nBased on the imaging findings, which of the complications [Microcirculation Dysfunction,Intramyocardial Hemorrhage,Ventricular Thrombus,Ventricular Aneurysm] of **right ventricular** exist? ( Note the answer maybe none)."
