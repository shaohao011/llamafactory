The left atrial anteroposterior diameter is approximately 31mm, and the right atrial anteroposterior diameter is about 29mm. The left ventricular end-diastolic diameter is around 59mm, and the right ventricular end-diastolic diameter is about 43mm. Cine MRI post-PCI reveals a stent in the anterior descending branch area and a low-signal thrombus at the left ventricular apex. There is uncoordinated wall motion in the left ventricle, with reduced systolic and diastolic function in the apical segments, central septal wall, and anterior wall. The anterior wall of the apical segment is thinned. Tricuspid valve area shows bundle-like regurgitation during systole, and the aortic valve area shows bundle-like regurgitation during diastole. A small amount of fluid signal is seen in the pericardium, with no fluid signals in the bilateral pleural cavities. The anterior wall of the right ventricular basal segment protrudes locally, showing paradoxical motion. T2FS imaging shows transmural and subendocardial patchy high signals in the basal to apical septal wall of the left ventricle, with arc-shaped low signals in the myocardium, corresponding to low signals on T2*. Patchy high signals are seen in the apical segments of the left ventricle, with no abnormal signals in the left ventricular papillary muscles. Resting myocardial perfusion imaging reveals transmural patchy perfusion defects in the central to apical septal wall, anterior septal wall, and inferior septal wall of the left ventricle. Delayed enhancement imaging shows delayed enhancement in the basal to apical septal wall of the left ventricle, partially transmural, with transmural delayed enhancement in the apical segments and apex, and slight delayed enhancement in the central anterior wall. The enhancement range is slightly smaller than that shown on T2FS. The arc-shaped low signals in the myocardium are similar to those on T2FS. The thrombus at the apex shows no enhancement.

Cine MRI shows significantly reduced left ventricular wall motion, with a band-like low signal flow towards the atrial side in the mitral valve region during systole, and a small amount of fluid signal within the pericardium. Myocardial rest perfusion imaging reveals linear signals in the left ventricular septal, anterior, and lateral walls. Myocardial delayed enhancement imaging shows transmural high signals with low signal areas in the left ventricular septal, anterior, and lateral walls.

The anterior-posterior diameter of the left atrium is approximately 48.7mm, and the end-diastolic anterior-posterior diameter of the left ventricle is about 48.8mm. The left ventricular wall thickness varies across different levels: at the base, the anterior septum is 14.4mm, anterior wall 10.5mm, lateral wall 10.3mm, inferolateral wall 4.9mm, inferior wall 6.5mm, and posterior septum 12.1mm; at the papillary muscle level, the anterior septum is 12.1mm, anterior wall 7.4mm, lateral wall 7.5mm, inferolateral wall 5.2mm, inferior wall 4.6mm, and posterior septum 12.2mm; at the apex, the septal wall is 7.7mm, anterior wall 7.5mm, lateral wall 8.4mm, and inferior wall 6.4mm; the apex itself is 2.2mm thick. MRI cine shows thinning and akinesis of the anterior septum and anterior wall at the papillary muscle level extending to the apex, with hypokinesis in other segments. No stenosis or regurgitation is observed in the mitral, tricuspid, or aortic valves. T2-weighted fat-suppressed images reveal high signal intensity in the anterior wall and anterior septum at the papillary muscle level extending to the apex, with a linear low signal within the high signal area at the apex. Myocardial perfusion imaging shows no delayed perfusion or perfusion defects. Delayed enhancement imaging shows delayed enhancement in the anterior septum and anterior wall at the papillary muscle level extending to the apex, with non-enhancing areas within the enhanced regions. The ejection fraction is 46%, end-diastolic volume 87.2ml, end-systolic volume 47.0ml, stroke volume 40.1ml, and cardiac output 3.17L/min.\n</imaging findings>\n\nBased on the imaging findings, please predict the likelyhood of the patient experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) within 86 months following the imaging examination, and answer with high or low."

The anterior-posterior diameter of the left atrium was approximately 36.4 mm, the right atrium was about 35.0 mm, the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was about 40.9 mm, and the right ventricular end-diastolic diameter was about 25.4 mm. Cine MRI indicated normal opening and closing of the atrioventricular valves with no abnormal regurgitation signals. The left ventricular wall showed no significant thinning, but reduced wall motion was observed in the basal to apical segments of the inferior septum, inferior wall, and inferolateral wall, with decreased left ventricular systolic function. A small amount of fluid signal was seen in the pericardium, and no arc-shaped fluid signals were observed in the bilateral pleural cavities. T2 fat-suppressed images showed increased myocardial signal in the septum, inferior wall, and lateral wall of the left ventricle. Myocardial perfusion imaging revealed a subendocardial linear perfusion defect in the basal to apical segments of the left ventricular inferior wall. Myocardial viability scanning showed transmural high-signal delayed enhancement in the basal to apical segments of the inferior septum, left and right ventricular inferior walls, and the basal to mid segments of the left ventricular inferolateral wall, with patchy lower signal areas in the basal segment of the inferior wall. Left ventricular end-diastolic wall thickness (in millimeters) was as follows: anterior wall (9.5, 7.6, 3.9, 1.8), anterior septum (12.2, 9.0, 5.6), inferior/posterior septum (12.5, 8.4, 4.7), inferior/posterior wall (8.5, 7.6, 4.8), inferolateral wall (10.0, 7.2), and anterolateral wall (7.5, 5.5).

Left ventricular function measurements include an EF of 62.23%, EDV of 150.4 ml, ESV of 56.8 ml, SV of 93.6 ml, CO of 6.9 L/min, and LV mass of 129 g. Stress perfusion imaging shows reduced perfusion signals in the basal to apical segments of the left ventricular wall, partially transmural. Rest perfusion imaging shows no abnormalities in the left ventricular myocardial rest perfusion signals. Delayed enhancement imaging shows subendocardial spotty and linear slightly high-signal shadows in the basal to mid segments of the left ventricular wall.\n</imaging findings>\n\nBased on the imaging findings, please predict the likelyhood of the patient experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) within 11 months following the imaging examination, and answer with high or low."

The left ventricular end-diastolic diameter is about 51mm, and the right ventricular end-diastolic diameter is 27mm. The left ventricular end-diastolic wall thickness varies across segments, with the basal segment showing increased thickness in the septal wall and thinning in the mid-ventricular to apical segments, accompanied by reduced wall motion and decreased systolic and diastolic functions. No regurgitation signals are observed in the mitral, tricuspid, or aortic valve areas, and no fluid signals are seen in the pericardium or bilateral pleural cavities. Resting myocardial perfusion imaging shows linear low-signal shadows in the anterior and septal walls of the apical segment of the left ventricular wall. Delayed myocardial imaging reveals transmural high-signal stripes in the anterior and septal walls of the mid-ventricular to apical segments. T2-weighted imaging shows patchy high-signal areas in the apical myocardium of the left ventricular wall, with no signal reduction on fat-suppressed images. The ejection fraction is 43.79%, with an end-diastolic volume of 176.61ml, end-systolic volume of 99.27ml, stroke volume of 77.33ml, cardiac output of 4.75L/min, and left ventricular mass of 152.7g.
